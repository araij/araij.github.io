# 新井 淳也 (ARAI Junya)

Senior Research Engineer at the Computer and Data Science Laboratories, NTT, Inc. (formerly Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation).

I received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Information Science and Technology from the University of Tokyo in 2011 and 2013, respectively. After joining NTT in 2013, I received a Ph.D. in Information Science from Osaka University in 2019. My research interests include parallel distributed computing and graph algorithms. I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Database Society of Japan (DBSJ), and the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ).

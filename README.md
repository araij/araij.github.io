# 新井 淳也 (ARAI Junya)

Senior Research Engineer at the Computer and Data Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT).

I received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Information Science and Technology from the University of Tokyo in 2011 and 2013, respectively. After joining NTT in 2013, I received a Ph.D. in Information Science from Osaka University in 2019. My research interests include parallel distributed computing and graph algorithms. I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Database Society of Japan.
